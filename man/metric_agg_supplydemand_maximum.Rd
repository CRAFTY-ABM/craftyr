\title{Calculates the maximum percental demand supply gap for across services for all ticks}
\usage{
metric_agg_supplydemand_maximum(simp, services = NULL, regions = NULL,
  datanamedemand = "csv_aggregated_demand",
  datanamesupply = "csv_aggregated_supply", considerundersupply = TRUE,
  consideroversupply = FALSE, includesum = FALSE, asvector = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{simp}{}

\item{services}{vector of character. Limits set of considered services if not \code{NULL}.}

\item{regions}{vector of character. Limits set of considered regions if not \code{NULL}.}

\item{consideroversupply}{}

\item{includesum}{if \code{TRUE} computes the sum across all services}

\item{asvector}{if \code{TRUE} metric is returned as named vector}
}
\value{
data.frame with cols Metric, Ticks and Value or named vector (ticks) of metric (percental demand supply gap) when \code{asvector == TRUE}
			Metric will be negative in case of undersupply and positive in case of oversupply.
